# Email Campaign Effectiveness Prediction
These project is part of the “Supervised Machine Learning” curriculum as capstone projects at [AlmaBetter](https://www.almabetter.com/). 

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Problem Statement and Project Description<br>
Many small and medium business owners are successfully utilizing Gmail-based email marketing to convert potential customers into leads and retain their loyalty. The ultimate goal is to develop a machine learning model that can categorize and track emails based on reader actions such as ignoring, reading, or acknowledging them.

Email advertising involves sending mass promotional emails to customers to generate income or leads, and may include advertising. The primary advantage of email marketing is its ability to establish relationships with new, past, and potential customers by directly communicating with them in their inbox at their convenience. When used with effective messaging and strategies, email is among the most crucial marketing channels.

Email campaign effectiveness refers to the analysis of businesses' email campaigns to determine their success in achieving marketing and promotional objectives. It is crucial for businesses to track their campaigns' performance to optimize their strategies.

This study characterizes and predicts email engagement based on various features in the dataset to determine if emails will be ignored, read, or acknowledged. The goal is to reduce the number of ignored emails and offer recommendations for improvement.

### Methods Used
* Descriptive Statistics
* Data Visualization
* Machine Learning


### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* XGBoost


## Project Description
* EDA - Performed exploratory data analysis on numerical and categorical data.
* Data Cleaning - Missing value imputation,Outlier Treaatment
* Imabalance handling - First tried Under sampling and implemented baseline models then due to loss of information moved to different technique i.e oversampling using SMOTE and got better results.
* Feature Selection - Used information gain for feature selection and dropped features which had less information gain
* Model development - Tried different model and finally compared all models F1 and roc_auc score.

## Needs of this project

- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- predictive modeling
